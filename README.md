> AI-based simulator for optimized mobility in buildings like classrooms in OsloMet areas to reduce risks of Covid-19 spread.

The task at hand is to develop a simulator to visualize and run experiments to assess the effects of the mobility of people at campus and optimize the effects of different measures with an artificial intelligence algorithm.

In order to accomplish this, we aim to experiment with and optimize an agent-based model using an evolutionary algorithm.
